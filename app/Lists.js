            content:`Sometimes, too much freedom does look like you are being caged. Happiness starts getting boring and you start feeling like your whole life lacks drama. Of course, you do not want to relate to women’s story at the salon but sometimes, you just feel like you’re missing out. I got married to someone women call ‘perfect’ and twitter calls ‘simp’. When I told him I’d go to the market alone today, he looked into my eyes like it’d be the last time he’d see me, help my hands and rubbed a little before he whispered, ‘how careful would you be?’. And if his work has not gotten a little demanding these days, he would have pleaded with his eyes, till I see him as the son I have not had, hold him like my handbag and gist with him to the market.Nothing in the world prepared me for seeing Akin again, he is standing just as he was. He still has the usual haircut, camry, I used to laugh at how it was, flat at the front, little bump at the middle and flat at the back too, such that when one sees his head from the side, it would look like the shape of a camry – maybe not exactly. He stands beside his car with his head running through the 360 degrees, he puts one hand on his car and the other to his waist, I could easily tell he is waiting for someone. 
            ‘Akin’, I call out. With the way his eyes are scanning every direction, I can tell he will see me anyways.
            He takes a long stare before giving me a wide embrace. He takes a step back, pause, another one, pause again with his two hands now to his waist. He let out a big grin before calling my name.
            ‘Molayo, who can imagine I’d see you again’. I give an awkward -I-don’t-know-what-to-do’ smile and before I can find the next word to alter, he continues, ‘I still have your contact, I will make sure I message you tonight’. He looks away from me and when I follow his gaze, I see a lady finding her way through the market crowd wearing a flowing bubu. She holds the hem of the gown with one hand and more than three filled polythene bags with the other hand. She is the same one I know. It amuses me that they are still together.
            ‘You should know Molayo, my friend then’, she gave a smirk and I know she would remember me, I remember her too. She rubs her stomach as she whispers, ‘Good afternoon, nice meeting you’. I respond a “Afternoon, it’s so nice meeting you as well” with a big smile and a “yes, I can see you’re pregnant” thought.
            “Alright, Akin”, I made to move forward and I can feel her eyes cutting through me and Akin just smiling. I maneuver my way into the market as I shake a ‘No’ head to market women calling me to buy their products.
            Akin was this type of guy women are around but can’t figure why they are around him. I know I started talking to him because I love his voice but I do not know what kept me with him for 2 years. You cannot call him “charming”, he is a 5’5’’ tall guy with a straight back and flat chest, the type that looks like your driver when you dress too expensive. His face, just the middle guy, looks cute when you are pleased with him and so ugly when he is offensive. He however has a bold smile, a perfect dentition and I do joke with him that God used a day to create him, then use 6 days to work on his mouth. 
            He was a perfect lover, or maybe he just knows how to make every lady feel special. He would visit my hostel a day to exam and explain the whole syllabus in two minutes. He would sit on my bed, rolling his full beards with his right hand and scribbling on my note with his left hand.`,
